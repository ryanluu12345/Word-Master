# Word-Master
A simple scrabble-like game, written in Python, that allows you to go to head to head with as many players as you want.


How it Works: Each main aspect of the game is contained within either the class setUp() or a variety of methods that are used for assigning letters, keeping score, checking validity of words, and drawing the game board. There is a try/except statement in the "word check" portion that checks the validity of a word via dictionary.com. 

Caution: Just know that when entering letters, be careful about the order in which you enter letters and the spacing of the letters. You might end up having to restart the game if it doesn't work out. Also, all of the decision making for the played letters is done through the command line.
